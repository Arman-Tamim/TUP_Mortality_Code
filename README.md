# TUP_Mortality_Code

This is a repository that consists of codes for the TUP mortality paper.  

Set your directory using the "Directory_TUP_health" do file. First, you need to create these folders in your desired desktop location and then set them by running the code.  

Once the directory setup is done, first run the "ind_ANCOVA" file, then "attrition," and finally "Mortality_clean" for cleaning the data.  

The "ind_subgroup_analysis" do file will produce the morbidity outcomes in "Table 1" and "Table 2."  

The "illness_coefplot" do file will produce "Figure 3."  

The "mortality_selected" do file will produce "Table 3" and "Table 4."  

The "Mortality_combined_coefplot" do file will produce "Figure 4."  

The "hazard" do file will produce "Figure 5."
